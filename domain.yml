    text: The source of reinfection was wild poliovirus originating from Nigeria. A subsequent intense vaccination campaign in Africa, however, led to an apparent elimination of the disease from the region; no cases had been detected for more than a year in 2014‚Äì15.
  utter_polio_prevent:
  - image: https://images.everydayhealth.com/images/kids-health/ways-to-ease-your-babys-vaccination-pain-08-1440x180.jpg
    text: The best way to prevent polio is by vaccination. The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is given as a shot and is the only type of polio vaccine available in the United States. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) was discontinued in 2000. Children should receive four doses of IPV vaccine starting at 2 months of age.
  utter_eradicate:
  - text: In 1994, the Indian Government launched the Pulse Polio Campaign to eliminate polio. The current campaign involves annual vaccination of all children under age five.
  utter_vaccine_date:
  - text: In India, vaccination against polio started on 1985 with Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). By 1999, it covered around 60% of infants, giving three doses of OPV to each. In 1985, the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) was launched to cover all the districts of the country.
  utter_age_limit:
  - text: For protection, all children must be immunized against polio, with OPV every time it is offered- up to age 5.
  utter_inventedpoliovaccine:
  - text: In 1955, the campaign bore fruit when Dr Jonas Salk developed the first vaccine against polio ‚Äì an injectable, inactivated polio vaccine. In 1961, Dr Albert Sabin developed a "live" oral polio vaccine (OPV) which rapidly became the vaccine of choice for most national immunization programmes globally.

    text: 'Vaccines for polio attacks are:'
  utter_ipv:
  - text: IPV consists of a series of injections that start 2 months after birth and continue until the child is 4 to 6 years old. This version of the vaccine is provided to most children in the U.S. The vaccine is made from inactive poliovirus. It is very safe and effective and cannot cause polio.
  utter_opv:
  - text: OPV is created from a weakened form of poliovirus. This version is the vaccine of choice in many countries because it is low cost, easy to administer, and gives an excellent level of immunity. However, in very rare cases, OPV has been known to revert to a dangerous form of poliovirus, which is able to cause paralysis.
  utter_poliocount:
  - text: |-
      ü§û The annual number of wild poliovirus cases has declined by more than 99.9% worldwide from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched.
      ü§û Of the three serotypes of wild poliovirus, type 2 was certified as eradicated in 2015 and type 3 was certified as eradicated in 2018.
  utter_poliocountperyear:
  - text: Polio does still exist, although polio cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated more than 350 000 cases to 22 reported cases in 2017. This reduction is the result of the global effort to eradicate the disease.
  utter_firstpersonaffected:
  - text: 1894, first outbreak of polio in epidemic form in the U.S. occurs in Vermont, with 132 cases. 1908, Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper identify a virus as the cause of polio by transmitting the disease to a monkey.
  utter_calipers:
  - text: Calipers are devices that enable people with motor disabilities ‚Äî including polio-afflicted patients ‚Äî to walk and thereby remain mobile. While polio has been eradicated from India and as such there are no new polio cases detected, patients with polio continue to throng BMVSS to get calipers fitted.
  - text: An orthotics or caliper is used to repair, support, immobilize a body part in order to help patients suffering from locomotor disability restore weight bearing capabilities to the affected legs and permit the patient to steer while risk of falls and additional fractures

  - text: Being underweight can represent as many health concerns to an individual as being overweight can. If a person is underweight, their body may not be getting the nutrients it needs to build healthy bones, skin, and hair.
  utter_calipers invented:
  - text: Introduced in 1998, light-weight calipers for the polio-affected was such a concept. It was a brainchild of Kalam, when he was the director of Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) in Hyderabad, and BN Prasad, then head of orthopedics at the Nizam‚Äôs Institute of Medical Sciences. The calipers were made of glass-filled polypropylene, used in missiles ‚Äî reducing their weight from four kilogram to 400 grams, providing relief to users.

  utter_poliotreat:
  - text: There's no cure for polio, but a vaccine allows your body to fight off the virus. Before the vaccine became available in the 1950s, the virus paralyzed thousands of people each year. By the 1970s, because many people had the vaccine, there were fewer than 10 cases of polio in the U.S.

  utter_diagnose:
  - text: Dignose :Once the polio virus is isolated it is tested by a special test called oligonucleotide mapping (fingerprinting) or genomic sequencing. This is essentially looking at the genetic sequence of the virus to detect if the origin of the virus is ‚Äúwild type‚Äù or ‚Äúvaccine like‚Äù.
  utter_virusofpolio:

  utter_childrengetpolio:
  - text: The virus often spreads through contact with infected feces (stool). It can be spread when an infected child coughs or sneezes infected droplets into the air. A child is more at risk for polio if they are in an area where polio is still active.
  utter_istherecure:
  - text: There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life.

  utter_administered:
  - text: '! IPV is given as shot in the arm or leg. ! OPV is given as an oral liquid is no longer used in US, but is still given in other parts of the world'
  utter_available:
  - text: First polio vaccine was inactive, or killed vaccine(IPV) developed by Dr. Jonas Salk and licensed in 1995.
  utter_whyvaccine:
  - text: children must be vaccinated because polio still exists in parts of africa and asia and can easily be imported. When polio eliminated from the world, polio virus became part of history.  but we are not to the point yet
  utter_adults:
  - text: If an adult is at increase risk of exposure and has  never been vaccinated against polio, they should receive 3 doses of IPV, the first two doses given 1 -2  months apart, and the third 6 - 12 months after the second.

  utter_safe:
  - text: The IPV vaccine is very safe, no series adverse reactions to IPV have been documented.
  utter_effective:
  - text: IPV is very effective in preventing polio, but only when all recommended doses are completed. A single dose of IPV produces little or no immunity but 99% of reciepients are immuned after 3 doses
  utter_notreceive:
  - text: Anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of polio vaccine should not get another one. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time a shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover to get vaccine.
  utter_ipvpolio:
