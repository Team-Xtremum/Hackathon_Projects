      üëâüèªPolio, or poliomyelitis, is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus.
      üëâüèªThe virus spreads from person to person and can infect a person‚Äôs spinal cord, causing paralysis (can‚Äôt move parts of the body).

    text: The source of reinfection was wild poliovirus originating from Nigeria. A subsequent intense vaccination campaign in Africa, however, led to an apparent elimination of the disease from the region; no cases had been detected for more than a year in 2014‚Äì15.
  utter_polio_prevent:
  - image: https://images.everydayhealth.com/images/kids-health/ways-to-ease-your-babys-vaccination-pain-08-1440x180.jpg
    text: The best way to prevent polio is by vaccination. The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is given as a shot and is the only type of polio vaccine available in the United States. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) was discontinued in 2000. Children should receive four doses of IPV vaccine starting at 2 months of age.
  utter_eradicate:
  - text: In 1994, the Indian Government launched the Pulse Polio Campaign to eliminate polio. The current campaign involves annual vaccination of all children under age five.
  utter_vaccine_date:
  - text: In India, vaccination against polio started on 1985 with Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). By 1999, it covered around 60% of infants, giving three doses of OPV to each. In 1985, the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) was launched to cover all the districts of the country.
  utter_age_limit:
  - text: For protection, all children must be immunized against polio, with OPV every time it is offered- up to age 5.
  utter_inventedpoliovaccine:
  - text: In 1955, the campaign bore fruit when Dr Jonas Salk developed the first vaccine against polio ‚Äì an injectable, inactivated polio vaccine. In 1961, Dr Albert Sabin developed a "live" oral polio vaccine (OPV) which rapidly became the vaccine of choice for most national immunization programmes globally.
  utter_polioaffect:

    - payload: opv
      title: Oral Polio Vaccine(OPV)
    text: 'Vaccines for polio attacks are:'
  utter_ipv:
  - text: IPV consists of a series of injections that start 2 months after birth and continue until the child is 4 to 6 years old. This version of the vaccine is provided to most children in the U.S. The vaccine is made from inactive poliovirus. It is very safe and effective and cannot cause polio.
  utter_opv:
  - text: OPV is created from a weakened form of poliovirus. This version is the vaccine of choice in many countries because it is low cost, easy to administer, and gives an excellent level of immunity. However, in very rare cases, OPV has been known to revert to a dangerous form of poliovirus, which is able to cause paralysis.
  utter_poliocount:
  - text: |-
      ü§û The annual number of wild poliovirus cases has declined by more than 99.9% worldwide from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched.
      ü§û Of the three serotypes of wild poliovirus, type 2 was certified as eradicated in 2015 and type 3 was certified as eradicated in 2018.
  utter_poliocountperyear:
  - text: Polio does still exist, although polio cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated more than 350 000 cases to 22 reported cases in 2017. This reduction is the result of the global effort to eradicate the disease.
  utter_firstpersonaffected:
  - text: Major polio epidemics were unknown before the 20th century; localized paralytic polio epidemics began to appear in Europe and the United States around 1900. The first report of multiple polio cases was published in 1843 and described an 1841 outbreak in Louisiana.
  utter_calipers:
  - text: Calipers are devices that enable people with motor disabilities ‚Äî including polio-afflicted patients ‚Äî to walk and thereby remain mobile. While polio has been eradicated from India and as such there are no new polio cases detected, patients with polio continue to throng BMVSS to get calipers fitted.
  - text: An orthotics or caliper is used to repair, support, immobilize a body part in order to help patients suffering from locomotor disability restore weight bearing capabilities to the affected legs and permit the patient to steer while risk of falls and additional fractures
  utter_calipers_kg:

  utter_weight_reduced:
  - text: Weight is reduced due to the carbon carbon bonding(C=C) which is a covalent bond
  utter_persons_invented:
  - text: Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Nims director Dr L. Narendranath together invented low-weight ortho calipers in 1993.
  utter_restart:

  utter_worked with:
  - text: Nims director DR L.Narendranath who works closely with DR A.P.J , to develop low weight calipers using space age materials.
  utter_under weight:
  - text: Being underweight can represent as many health concerns to an individual as being overweight can. If a person is underweight, their body may not be getting the nutrients it needs to build healthy bones, skin, and hair.
  utter_calipers invented:
  - text: Introduced in 1998, light-weight calipers for the polio-affected was such a concept. It was a brainchild of Kalam, when he was the director of Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) in Hyderabad, and BN Prasad, then head of orthopedics at the Nizam‚Äôs Institute of Medical Sciences. The calipers were made of glass-filled polypropylene, used in missiles ‚Äî reducing their weight from four kilogram to 400 grams, providing relief to users.

    text: Images and events in Belgaum, Karnataka on October 15, 2004 keeps coming back to Dr. L. Narendranath, as he sits in his chambers in Hyderabad-based Nizam‚Äôs Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) on Tuesday and reflects the day‚Äôs significance. That day marked President Kalam‚Äôs birthday and it was also the day when his dream to deliver affordable lightweight callipers to the polio-stricken actually became a reality.

  utter_affected country:
  - text: Pakistan reported the world's highest number of polio cases (198) in 2011.
  utter_first discoverd:
  - text: The first epidemics appeared in the form of outbreaks of at least 14 cases near Oslo, Norway, in 1868 and of 13 cases in northern Sweden in 1881. About the same time the idea began to be suggested that the hitherto sporadic cases of infantile paralysis might be contagious.
  utter_invented country:
  - text: Some European countries imported the Salk IPV from the US whereas some other like the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden started production of Salk IPV in their own public health production units [9].
  - text: "Year of discovery\t1956(Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis (VAPP))\t2000(Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV))"
  utter_vaccine created:
  - text: The first inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was produced by Salk using virus grown on monkey kidney cells and inactivated with formalin. In 1954, the inactivated vaccine was tested in a placebo-controlled trial, which enrolled 1.6 million children in Canada, Finland and the United States.
  utter_man made virus:
  - text: The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease occurs naturally only in humans. The disease is preventable with the polio vaccine; however, multiple doses are required for it to be effective.
  utter_virus created:
  - text: Using a genetic recipe from the Internet and mail-order DNA, scientists in New York have built an infectious polio virus from scratch, raising the grim prospect that bioterrorists could eventually create their own virulent diseases in test tubes.
  utter_chemicals:

  utter_topic:

  utter_poliospreads:
  - text: Polio is spread when the stool of an infected person is introduced into the mouth of another person through contaminated water or food (fecal-oral transmission). Oral-oral transmission by way of an infected person's saliva may account for some cases.
